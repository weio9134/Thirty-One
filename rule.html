        <h1> INSTRUCTIONS </h1>
        <ul>
            <li> You start with a hand of 3 cards </li>
            <li> When it's your turn, you may swap one of your cards with the cards in the middle </li>
            <li> Your goal is to create the best possible hand against the other players </li>
            <li> Highest possible hand value is 31 but good luck getting that </li>
            <li> Only cards in the same suit may count towards your score </li>
            <li> Aces are worth 11, face cards 10, and others are worth their face value </li>
            <li> If you have 3 matching cards, your score is 30 </li>
            <li> When you believe you have a good hand, you may 'knock' </li>
            <li> When you or others 'knock,' the other players still have one more chance to swap cards </li>
            <li> Then, all hands are revealed. Lowest hand loses that round </li>
            <li> 3 strikes and you're out </li>
            <li> Good luck, have fun </li>
        </ul>
