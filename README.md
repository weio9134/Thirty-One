# Thirty-One
A rummy-style card game.
The objective: achieve a hand of cards with the highest possible value (31).
Restrictions: only cards of the same suit can be counted towards your value.
Rules:
1) Aces are counted as 11 and face cards are worth 10
2) You take turns against AIs to compete for the highest hand
3) You may swap out your cards from the discard or deck pile
4) You (and the AI) may 'knock' whenever.
5) GLHF!
